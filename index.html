        新日本語ガイ <b><u>New Japanese Guide</u></b>
      </h3>

      <p>
        I know that the following guide is long. But language learning is
        something you do in the long term, so please take the time to read this
        guide in its entirety. I apologize if this guide may get a little
        scientific, and I will not write a simplified version of this guide.
        Everything stated below is what you need to know. Sorry about that.
      </p>

      <h4>Why many people "fail" to learn Japanese</h4>

      <p>
        Before I talk about this, I would like to clarify what I mean by "fail."
        What I mean is, not being able to achieve their goals. Many people love
        the idea of being fluent, and being able to watch Japanese media without
        subtitles, in their raw form. However, many people also don't ever reach
        this goal or even get close. I believe it mostly isn't their fault, but
        rather, the method's fault. Whether you're a "visual learner" or an
        "auditory learner" does not mean anything when it comes to learning a
        language, you have a big problem if you acquired your first language
        auditorily, but apparently, you're more of a "visual learner." It mostly
        comes down to the method used to study Japanese. There are other
        factors, too, such as motivation, or hours spent each day/consistency.
        But I believe the process in the first place is critical. For example,
        if someone told you that you could lose weight by pedaling on an
        exercise bike while watching TV, and you did this for two hours every
        day, would you lose weight? No. That is because this is a fundamentally
        flawed method - it does not work.
      </p>
      <p>
        This guide aims to educate you on effective methods to study Japanese so
        that you don't end up like the others that failed and instead succeed,
        all while having fun in your target language. In this case, your target
        language is most likely Japanese Back to the "visual learner" and
        "auditory learner" thing, while it may be right for other fields of
        study, it is not valid for acquiring a language. We all receive
        communication in the same way, and that is through comprehensible input.
        I often come across people saying, "everyone learns differently" This
        may be true for other fields of study but not for language acquisition.
        Keyword: Acquisition.
      </p>

      <h4>Learning vs. Acquisition</h4>

      <p>
        Learning a language properly refers to a conscious process, similar to
        what one experiences in school. The individual receives "grammar rules"
        and(or) a "vocabulary list" to remember. When it comes to communicating
        in the language, they recall these rules and vocab they have learned and
        try to speak the language. According to Krashen, this is less effective
        than Acquisition.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Acquisition of language is a natural, intuitive, and subconscious
        process that individuals need no awareness. This ability means that this
        process is fundamentally the same for everyone; hence, natural and
        acquired pieces of language utilizes intuitively, where the individual,
        in opposition to learning, does not need time to think and form
        sentences using learned grammar and vocabulary. And finally,
        subconscious means that the individual is unaware that the process is
        happening; the acquisition process may not feel like "language
        learning." When new knowledge is acquired, the acquirer does not feel
        like they have learned anything. The acquisition requires meaningful
        interaction with the target language, during which the acquirer focuses
        on meaning rather than form. This method means, one is not concerned
        with the structure of the language they hear and(or) their utterances.
        They are with the messages they are conveying and understanding.<b
          >"Learning Japanese" may improperly refer to both acquiring and
          learning. So please keep that in mind.</b
        >
      </p>

      <h4>i + 1</h4>

      <p>
        If i represents previously acquired linguistic competence and
        extra-linguistic knowledge, the hypothesis claims that we move from i to
        i+1 by understanding input that contains i+1. Extra-linguistic
        instruction includes our understanding of the world and the situation,
        that is, the context. The +1 represents 'the next increment' of new
        knowledge or language structure within the learner's capacity to
        acquire. In simpler terms, i+1 means "one [and no more than one] thing
        [piece of language] you do not yet know in the sentence."
      </p>

      <h4>Comprehensible Input</h4>
      <p>
        The input itself refers to listening and reading to native content in
        the target language. Mass data accumulation refers to as immersion.
        Native content means content made by natives, for natives. (raw) Natives
        make anime for natives; therefore, it is native content. Comprehensible
        input refers to input where messages are conveyed and understood. It is
        the most crucial ingredient in the Acquisition of language. Any data is
        not sufficient for Acquisition, the data must be understandable.
        However, as a beginner, it may seem challenging to find comprehensible
        input, and that is true. I will touch later on how you can benefit from
        incomprehensible information, too, but not in the same way. You do not
        acquire language from incomprehensible input but comprehensible input.
        So please keep that in mind. It is also essential to keep in mind that
        talking (output) is not practicing a language. When people give
        anecdotes of how they got better at a speech by speaking a lot, they do
        not realize that it was the input (from the partner), which improved
        their language skills. Speaking (output) is just the icing on the cake,
        and data(input) is where you acquire language.
      </p>

      <h4>Knowing who's advice to trust</h4>

      <p>
        It may seem natural to take as many people's opinions as possible; after
        all, they have the experience, right? Maybe you can learn something
        valuable? Well, not quite. If the person you are taking advice from has
        not achieved similar goals you're aiming for; you cannot trust their
        information. If you do, you will get no better than the low level they
        are now. As a beginner, you have no way to accurately judge someone's
        language ability, as your linguistic competence is very low or virtually
        nonexistent. Therefore you are no one to decide if your friend is good
        at Japanese or not. Why is this important? Because I often come across
        people who say things like, "But my friend who learns Japanese told me
        that…" The thought that the friend told the other friend is usually
        pretty misguided and blatantly false. Has your friend achieved something
        close to what you want to make? If not, you do not have much luck
        getting past the low level they are at if you follow their advice. It
        would be like taking dieting advice from someone fat. " Learning"
        Japanese Effectively Now that you know the basics of language
        acquisition, let's dive into how to learn Japanese.
      </p>
    </div>

    <h4>Kana</h4>

    <p>
      Kana refers to Hiragana and Katakana, and they are the two scripts of the
      Japanese language. Hiragana and Katakana are two versions of the same
      sounds in the literature. Hiragana is used for words and names not written
      in kanji and for analytical purposes. The writer can choose whether or not
      to use the kanji form. We use Katakana for words borrowed from other
      languages and foreign names. We also use it for emphasis; however, the
      usages of hiragana and Katakana are not always consistent, so note that.
      The kana is not hard to master, and therefore I'd say, learn it however
      you want. It's better if you have audio with it, too. Mnemonics may seem
      like a good idea, but I've seen people complain that it makes recalling
      the kana slower, so I'd say just brute force it.
      <b>You need to learn this first.</b>I recommend you read Tae Kim (linked
      in #resources) and pause after The Writing System. After that, copy out
      the kana chart below and then test yourself.
    </p>

    <h5>The Chart:</h5>
    <img src="pictures/thechart.jpg" alt="the chart" width="600" height="600" />

    <h5>Steps if you got confused:</h5>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Read Tae Kim (linked in #resources) until you complete The Writing
        System
      </li>
      <li>Copy out the chart above into a notebook or something similar.</li>
      <li>Test yourself.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      After a week or so, you should have all the kana nailed down.
    </p>

    <h4>Kanji</h4>

    <p>
      Kanji, literally meaning "Chinese Characters" is the third part of the
      Japanese writing system. They are logographic and, therefore, much more
      complicated than kana. There are 2136 kanji taught in the Japanese school
      system; however, don't let this fool you. People use three thousand or
      more Kanji in daily life. People use Kanji all the time. You will
      eventually understand what this means when you get a little more advanced
      in Japanese.
    </p>
    <img src="pictures/kanji.jpg" alt="kanji" width="600" />

    <h6>
      Above is a page from the Love Live! Sunshine!! Manga, showing hiragana,
      Katakana, and Kanji.
    </h6>

    <h4>Approaching Kanji - Kanji With Vocab vs. Isolated Kanji Study</h4>

    <p>
      There are two ways to approach Kanji. One is <b>Kanji with vocab</b>,
      which is to learn words from reading without studying the individual
      Kanji. You can fully comprehend "守銭奴" without knowing what the
      individual Kanji means by looking it up in a dictionary. The other is
      <b>an isolated kanji study</b>, studying the meaning and composition of
      the individual Kanji. Example: "守" "guard" "銭" "coin" "奴" "guy" =
      cheapskate. Huh? It's pretty smart. Isolated kanji study can make
      remembering vocab easier, but it can put you behind due to the amount of
      time it takes, so it is up to you to decide whether it is worth it. If you
      struggle with reading words, then you should do an isolated kanji study. ※
      Another interesting thing about Kanji with vocab is that if you know other
      words that also use the Kanji of said word, it can become easier to
      remember. (Example: If you can comprehend "守護," "銭湯," and "売国奴,"
      then "守銭奴" becomes easier.)
    </p>

    <h4>How to: Kanji with Vocab</h4>

    <p>
      This method is the most straightforward approach to Kanji, and it is the
      approach I took personally. Look at the image above. Most people will read
      the kana just by referring to the kana chart, but you can't do the same
      for Kanji. So how do you learn to read Kanji? Look at the first panel. You
      see "人数"? That's a word. Look it up in a dictionary such as
      <a href="https://jisho.org/.">jisho</a> You get the reading: "にんずう"
      and the meaning: "number of people." Cool, move on. That's it. But don't
      expect to remember words just by looking it up once. That is why you
      should read a lot to build up and retain kanji skills. At the end of the
      guide, I will go through how to make looking up words smoother.
    </p>

    <h4>How to: Kanji with Isolation Study</h4>
    <img src="pictures/isolationkanji.png" />
    <h6>Image Credit: Daily Japanese Thread/Itazuraneko</h6>

    <p>
      When approaching Kanji as a beginner, they can look like scribbles rather
      than familiar shapes, like how a native sees Kanji. Kanji have common
      shapes and patterns, and Isolated Kanji Study helps you see those common
      shapes and designs. Instead of "草," looking like a random drawing, you
      can see that it's composed of "艹," "日," and "十." You can use RRTK
      (Recognition Remembering the Kanji), a shortened version of the original
      RTK (Remembering the Kanji). You can find more details about this over at
      <a
        href="https://massimmersionapproach.com/table-of-contents/stage-1/practice/recognition-rtk"
      >
        Mass Immersion Approach</a
      >.
    </p>
    <p>
      RRTK breaks up the Kanji into "elements," as demonstrated with the kanji
      "草" earlier. Seeing Kanji as familiar shapes is a primary benefit of
      RRTK, and memorizing the meanings is a secondary benefit. Knowing the
      purposes can be pretty handy; however, over time, these meanings fade away
      and only act as a crutch. To truly "learn" Kanji, you still need to read
      Japanese for thousands of hours, so in the end, you're going to be doing
      Kanji with vocab anyway. Think of isolated kanji study as your training
      wheels for Kanji with vocab.
    </p>

    <h4>Vocabulary</h4>

    <p>
      The bulk of your language learning journey is learning vocabulary to be
      doing a lot of it. I recommend you start learning vocabulary using Anki
      after learning the kana and knowing fundamental grammar. How basic it is,
      it is up to you to decide.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a href="https://apps.ankiweb.net/">Anki</a>is a spaced repetition (SRS)
      flashcard program.I recommend you use Anki to build up a vocabulary of
      essential words to assist your immersion. After that, learning vocabulary
      from immersion becomes easier. Usually, people use the Core 2K deck to
      build up a dictionary of two thousand words; however, I advise against
      using Core 2K and suggest you do Tango N5+N4 instead. Here's why:
    </p>
    <p>
      Core 2K is significantly harder than Tango N5+N4 because Tango has the
      sentence on the front, Core 2K has only the word on the front. Sentences
      make recalling vocabulary easier; after all, it is much more close to how
      we use language in real life than isolated words.
      <b
        >However, it is essential to note that Tango's translations are not
        literal and do not represent Japanese structure well, so I guess that's
        Tango's flaw. In other cases, it might be utterly wrong.</b
      >
      People have always struggled with Core 2K, and to make the process
      smoother, I recommend Tango N5+N4 over Core 2K. Especially if you don't
      want to do isolated kanji study!
    </p>

    <h4>Mining</h4>

    <p>
      Mining means when you add vocabulary (often along with the sentence
      they're discovered in) into your Anki deck. You can then review these
      flashcards overtime to make sure you don't forget them. Mining is
      something you will be doing for a long time, so this is pretty darn
      important. There's a lot of disagreement when it comes to "formats" of
      mining. I think you should just experiment and see what works best for
      you.
    </p>

    <p>
      There are two main formats of mining:
    </p>

    <p>
      i+1 Sentence Cards
    </p>
    <p>
      High-Quality Vocab Cards (known as Anime Cards)
    </p>
    <p>
      There has been no settlement to which one is the "best"; they each have
      their benefits and drawbacks.
    </p>

    <h4>
      i+1 Sentence Cards
    </h4>

    <p>
      I+1 Sentence Cards are cards with an i+1 sentence with all its Kanji on
      the front and the piece of information needed to understand what it means
      on the back. Let's go through the benefits and drawbacks.
    </p>
    <p><u>Benefits:</u></p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        Easier to judge whether you should pass (as opposed to failing) the
        card, as the task is simple: understand the sentence without revealing
        the back
      </li>
      <li>
        Less likely to mix up similar words, as their sentences are different.
      </li>
      <li>
        Easier overall, as sentences are closer to how we use language in real
        life.
      </li>
      <li>I+1 format is so inherently more accessible than the alternative.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><u>Drawbacks:</u></p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        Long to review as you need to read the full sentence every time. - As it
        is i+1, this may restrict what words you can put in your Anki deck. As
        you can only add sentences where there is one piece of language you do
        not yet know.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h4>High Quality Vocab Cards</h4>

    <p>
      Vocab cards are different from standard vocab cards. Standard vocab cards
      simply have the word in kanji form on the front and the reading and
      meaning of that word at the back. High-quality vocab cards, as opposed to
      standard vocab cards, have the audio of the sentence (from an anime or
      voiced VN), also a picture (from an anime or VN), and the sentence it came
      from at the back. Making them much more superior to standard vocab cards.
      ※ They are known as "Anime Cards" because of the
      <a href=" https://www.animecards.site/home">tutorial/site</a>
    </p>

    <p><u>Benefits:</u></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Quick to review. I average 500 cards in 30 minutes with these.</li>
      <li>Able to mine everything and anything (does not follow i+1)</li>
      <li>
        Animecards.site: "has the same benefits as sentence cards" this can be
        disputed, though.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p><u>Drawbacks:</u></p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Significantly harder than i+1 sentence cards. For the same reason, Core
        2K is harder than Tango N5+N4.
      </li>
      <li>Much more likely to mix up similar words.</li>
      <li>
        Not beginner-friendly. I do not recommend a beginner do this until they
        have at least 1000 i+1 sentence cards. We may not learn concepts as well
        as with i+1 sentence cards.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Grammar</h4>

    <p>
      When approaching grammar, it is essential to know that the purpose of a
      grammar guide is not to make you a master at the language. It is to give
      you only a basic understanding of how things work in the language, and
      then a real knowledge of grammar can only be achieved through immersion.
      Therefore, I recommend you choose a grammar guide, read/watch it,
      <b>and</b> do immersion.
    </p>

    <h4>Choosing A Grammar Guide</h4>

    <p>
      There are many grammar guides out there, some are good, but some are bad.
      To prevent confusion amongst learners, I will only mention two grammar
      guides. Tae Kim and Cure Dolly. No grammar guide is perfect; they each
      have their ups and downs. Tae Kim's guide reads pretty well and very
      beginner-friendly; however, some of his explanations may be a little off,
      which can get annoying to read. Cure Dolly takes an unorthodox approach to
      Japanese grammar, trying to teach Japanese grammar in a more Japanese
      "organic" way. However, Cure Dolly is not an absolute beginner-friendly
      way to start, and you need at least some background knowledge before using
      it. Also, the audio is poor.
    </p>

      With that said, I suggest doing grammar study in conjunction with your
      immersion and vocabulary study.
    </p>

    <h4>How to Immerse</h4>

    <p>
      What you need to do when immersing is different depending on what stage
      you are on. This reason is why making a one size fits all Japanese guide
      is tricky. I will only go through what you need to do as a beginner.
    </p>

    <h4>Listening</h4>

    <p>
      When you are a beginner, I recommend doing listening immersion over
      reading immersion. When you first approach a foreign language, you are not
      yet used to the phonemes (sounds) of the language. Reading may give you a
      poor accent, this is when you associate similar, yet wrong phonemes from
      your native language to Japanese. It is impossible to read without mapping
      some phonetic components, so you can only avoid this by first getting used
      to the phonemes. You can do this by doing raw listening. Secondly,
      listening just flows without stopping, so you feel more comfortable when
      immersing. On the other hand, reading as a beginner is very frustrating as
      you need to look up words probably every second continually. Surprisingly,
      there are many i+1 opportunities in listening immersion as a beginner, so
      it still passes as comprehensible input, even if you don't understand
      other parts. But language is not acquired through incomprehensible input,
      remember? That is true; however, you are still benefiting from
      incomprehensible information but in a different way; it improves your
      ability to distinguish phonemes; in other words, giving you a better
      accent. Immersing even if you don't understand much is also a great way to
      build up a habit of interacting with your target language. With that said,
      immersion (input) at this stage will still be mostly incomprehensible;
      however, you can change that by working through the Tango Anki decks.
      Please note that you need to pay attention to your immersion. (Active
      Immersion). Just putting it on in the background (Passive Immersion) is
      not going to help you.
    </p>

    <h4>Choosing what to immerse with</h4>
    <p>
      It's usually best to engage with a visual and audio component, such as
      anime and j-drama (TV Show). TV shows have a visual element, and also a
      plot, so this brings more i+1 opportunities. I do not recommend to immerse
      with say, a podcast or an audiobook as a beginner, as you will have no
      idea what's going on (incomprehensible input). If you're in this server
      (Learn Japanese with Anime), then chances are you are a fan of anime,
      cool. You can use that to immerse, and even anime you have seen in the
      past. What is also pretty helpful is reading an episode summary of the
      episode on Wikipedia before watching it, this can help you understand the
      plot more, so you can make more acquisition gains.
    </p>

    <h4>
      What do I need to be "doing" while actively immersing? (As a beginner)
    </h4>

    <p>
      Try to understand the messages. There is a lot you can infer from a TV
      show. Like Krashen says, you need to have "meaningful" (meaning-focused)
      interaction with the language, rather than focusing on form (such as
      grammar). I suggest trying to hear the sounds more clearly, too?
    </p>

    <h4>Reading</h4>

    <p>
      Reading, no matter what stage you are at, can benefit you greatly.
      However, as a beginner to the language, there are a few problems. You're
      still learning in the earlier stages of the learning process. Reading as
      soon as possible can harm your accent. And your reading ability may not
      always transfer (being able to hear the new words you learned) to your
      listening ability, especially if your listening ability is considerably
      low. When you're a beginner, I recommend watching Japanese subtitled anime
      for reading practice. Japanese subtitles are reading immersion at best,
      similar to a voiced visual novel. Having the voices in the background
      isn't going to save your accent nor improve your listening skill, you need
      to do raw listening. Sorry DJT. Anyway, I think it is good to start with
      Japanese subtitles for reading. And the transition to manga, and then
      light novels and so on. I believe it is essential you pace yourself when
      reading and don't burn out trying to read hard stories as a beginner; it
      is usually better reading books that are not too far off from your level.
      In our resources channel, you can find links to sites that let you read a
      lot of Japanese manga and novels (for free!) There are Japanese subtitles
      too, so make sure you check that out!
    </p>

    <h4>Finding the balance between listening and reading</h4>
    <p>
      Balance is important. It may be obvious just to split your time up in
      half, and if you can do that, then that is great. However, not everyone
      has the time, and when it comes to reading, depending on your current
      level, it's difficult to read for extended hours. For example, people that
      have gotten further in the Tango Anki deck may be able to read longer than
      those who are a little behind. So what is the perfect balance? I cannot
      answer that, that is up to you to experiment and decide. It all depends on
      your schedule and current level. You don't need to do reading from day 1,
      give it a few weeks until you can learn essential words from the Tango N5
      Anki deck.

    <h4>Now what?</h4>
    <i
      >(Some of the following information requires you to be in the discord for
      maximum effectiveness.)</i
    >
    <p>
      Learn the kana by copying out the entire chart posted in the Kana section
      into a notebook, or something similar. Use the @Kotoba bot in the #quiz
      channel to test your knowledge, there is a specific command you need to
      use, so it doesn't stop until you get them all right (brute-forcing)
    </p>
    <p>The command is as below:</p>
    <p>
      (if you're in the discord) k!quiz-conquest hiragana+katakana no delay
      After you have passed the @Kotoba quiz, then you should move on to
      learning vocabulary alongside grammar. It is vital that you pace yourself
      and don't try to punch above your weight; this is not a race.
    </p>
    <p>
      Download and set up Anki, you can find the link above or in #resources,
      then download the Tango N5 deck. You can find the download links for this
      in #resources in the Anki section. I've updated the link to use a safer
      file host. (Mediafire → Google Drive) You can import the Tango N5 deck by
      clicking on it. It should open in Anki, wait a while for it to import.
      Click the cog icon next to the deck > Options. The default limit of new
      cards per day set at 20. Try to stick with this number for a few days and
      see how it goes for you, if you feel like it is too much, you can lower
      the limit to 15 or even 10. Check in the "Reviews" tab, set the Maximum
      reviews/day to 9999. Don't be startled by this number. It will likely not
      go over 150 with an okay retention rate. If you fail to keep up with the
      reviews, you are getting, lower your new cards/day instead of reducing the
      maximum reviews. This method is because not doing your due reviews
      interferes with Anki's spaced repetition system. Anki requires consistency
      in the long term for it to be effective, try creating a schedule for it. I
      do my Anki when I wake up in the morning. Work on the Tango N5 Anki deck
      while reading/watching your chosen grammar guide. After you have finished
      Tango N5, do Tango N4, too. The download link for it is also in the
      #resources channel. You should also be nearing the end of your grammar
      guide at this point. I also suggest starting to read manga at this point.
      After you finished Tango N4, you should set up a mining deck. It doesn't
      matter that much which one you pick.

    <h4>The process of learning Japanese is as follows</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>Do Anki</li>
      <li>Watch native content</li>
      <li>Read native content</li>
      <li>repeat</li>
    </ol>

    <h4>Final Notes</h4>
    <p>
      That's it. You can get fluent in Japanese just like that. But don't forget
      that the most crucial part is immersion, Anki and grammar only assist your
      immersion. <b>Music is not immersion.</b> However, you can use the lyric
      sheet as reading practice. This guide would not have been possible if it
      was not for Stephen Krashen, Mass Immersion Approach, All Japanese All The
      Time, AntiMoon, Daily Japanese Thread/Itazuraneko, and my brothers and
      sisters here in Learn Japanese with Anime Discord. Thank you all!

    <h4>Additional Tools (optional read)</h4>

    <p>
      Get Yomichan. It is a browser extension. You can find it in #resources,
      and the dictionaries you need to load into it too. Download my dictionary
      pack (#resources), extract it (you can use 7zip). Do not touch the .zip
      files inside. These need to be kept intact. Click the icon, then click the
      monkey wrench icon scroll down until you see "Import Dictionary," over
      here, you need to import the ones with the [Bilingual] tag and
      (optionally) the [Kanji] tag at the stage you are in your studies. You can
      only import one dictionary at a time, so wait until one dictionary imports
      before downloading the next. Now you can look up words on a webpage by
      just holding Shift and hovering over it. Try it! For manga, I recommend
      KanjiTomo; it's like Yomichan, but for situations where you can't select
      the text, e.g., manga. It uses an OCR, so a little less reliable than
      Yomichan. To apply, hover your mouse over whatever you want to look up. If
      you have an Android device, you can use Yomichan on Firefox. Or
      JP-Dictionary (by @Kamui), which adds the iOS "Look Up" feature to your
      select menu, you can find this in #resources. There is also OCR Manga
      Reader (get it in #resources), which works like KanjiTomo. Typhon Reader,
      which operates more like Yomichan. You can load .epub files into it, so it
      is the best way to read Japanese novels on your phone. Individual EPWING
      dictionaries can load into Typhon Reader. I find this very useful. You can
      find EPWING dictionaries in #resources. There's also Kaku; it's a
      system-wide OCR. Pretty useful too. If you use an iOS device, you can use
      iBooks, or "Books" as it is in newer versions of iOS. You can use the
      "Look Up" feature. Make sure you have Japanese dictionaries enabled in
      Settings - General - Dictionary. If you intend on playing Visual Novels,
      then make sure you set up text hooking, you can find out how to do that
