        新日本語ガイ <b><u>New Japanese Guide</u></b>
      </h3>

      <p class="flow-text">
        I know that the following guide is long. But language learning is
        something you do in the long term, so please take the time to read this
        guide in its entirety. I apologize if this guide may get a little
        scientific, and I will not write a simplified version of this guide.
        Everything stated below is what you need to know. Sorry about that.
      </p>

      <h4 class="center">Why many people "fail" to learn Japanese</h4>

      <p class="flow-text">
        Before I talk about this, I would like to clarify what I mean by "fail."
        What I mean is, not being able to achieve their goals. Many people love
        the idea of being fluent, and being able to watch Japanese media without
        subtitles, in their raw form. However, many people also don't ever reach
        this goal or even get close. I believe it mostly isn't their fault, but
        rather, the method's fault. Whether you're a "visual learner" or an
        "auditory learner" does not mean anything when it comes to learning a
        language, you have a big problem if you acquired your first language
        auditorily, but apparently, you're more of a "visual learner." It mostly
        comes down to the method used to study Japanese. There are other
        factors, too, such as motivation, or hours spent each day/consistency.
        But I believe the process in the first place is critical. For example,
        if someone told you that you could lose weight by pedaling on an
        exercise bike while watching TV, and you did this for two hours every
        day, would you lose weight? No. That is because this is a fundamentally
        flawed method - it does not work.
      </p>
      <p class="flow-text">
        This guide aims to educate you on effective methods to study Japanese so
        that you don't end up like the others that failed and instead succeed,
        all while having fun in your target language. In this case, your target
        language is most likely Japanese Back to the "visual learner" and
        "auditory learner" thing, while it may be right for other fields of
        study, it is not valid for acquiring a language. We all receive
        communication in the same way, and that is through comprehensible input.
        I often come across people saying, "everyone learns differently" This
        may be true for other fields of study but not for language acquisition.
        Keyword: Acquisition.

      <h4 class="center">Learning vs. Acquisition</h4>

      <p class="flow-text">
        Learning a language properly refers to a conscious process, similar to
        what one experiences in school. The individual receives "grammar rules"
        and(or) a "vocabulary list" to remember. When it comes to communicating
        in the language, they recall these rules and vocab they have learned and
        try to speak the language. According to Krashen, this is less effective
        than Acquisition.
      </p>
      <p class="flow-text">
        The Acquisition of language is a natural, intuitive, and subconscious
        process that individuals need no awareness. This ability means that this
        process is fundamentally the same for everyone; hence, natural and
        acquired pieces of language utilizes intuitively, where the individual,
        in opposition to learning, does not need time to think and form
        sentences using learned grammar and vocabulary. And finally,
        subconscious means that the individual is unaware that the process is
        happening; the acquisition process may not feel like "language
        learning." When new knowledge is acquired, the acquirer does not feel
        like they have learned anything. The acquisition requires meaningful
        interaction with the target language, during which the acquirer focuses
        on meaning rather than form. This method means, one is not concerned
        with the structure of the language they hear and(or) their utterances.
        They are with the messages they are conveying and understanding.

          >"Learning Japanese" may improperly refer to both acquiring and
          learning. So please keep that in mind.</b
