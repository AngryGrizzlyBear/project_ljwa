    <h3>
      新日本語ガイ <b><u>New Japanese Guide</u></b>
    </h3>

    <p>
      I know that the following guide is long. But language learning is
      something you do in the long term, so please take the time to read this
      guide in its entirety. <br />
      I apologize if this guide may get a little scientific, and I will not
      write a simplified version of this guide. Everything stated below is what
      you need to know. <br />
      Sorry about that.
    </p>

    <h4>Why many people "fail" to learn Japanese</h4>

    <p>
      Before I talk about this, I would like to clarify what I mean by "fail."
      What I mean is, not being able to achieve their goals. Many people love
      the idea of being<br />fluent, and being able to watch Japanese media
      without subtitles, in their raw form. However, many people also don't ever
      reach this goal or even get close. I<br />believe it mostly isn't their
      fault, but rather, the method's fault. Whether you're a "visual learner"
      or an "auditory learner" does not mean anything when it comes<br />
      to learning a language, you have a big problem if you acquired your first
      language auditorily, but apparently, you're more of a "visual learner." It
      mostly comes<br />
      down to the method used to study Japanese. There are other factors, too,
      such as motivation, or hours spent each day/consistency. But I believe the
      process in the<br />first place is critical. For example, if someone told
      you that you could lose weight by pedaling on an exercise bike while
      watching TV, and you did this for two hours <br />every day, would you
      lose weight? No. That is because this is a fundamentally flawed method -
      it does not work.
    </p>
    <p>
      This guide aims to educate you on effective methods to study Japanese so
      that you don't end up like the others that failed and instead succeed, all
      while having fun in<br />your target language. In this case, your target
      language is most likely Japanese Back to the "visual learner" and
      "auditory learner" thing, while it may be right for other<br />fields of
      study, it is not valid for acquiring a language. We all receive
      communication in the same way, and that is through comprehensible input. I
      often come across people<br />saying, "everyone learns differently" This
      may be true for other fields of study but not for language acquisition.
      Keyword: Acquisition.

    <h4>Learning vs. Acquisition</h4>

    <p>
      Learning a language properly refers to a conscious process, similar to
      what one experiences in school. The individual receives "grammar rules"
      and(or) a "vocabulary list" to remember.<br />
      When it comes to communicating in the language, they recall these rules
      and vocab they have learned and try to speak the language. According to
      Krashen, this is less effective than<br />
      Acquisition.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Acquisition of language is a natural, intuitive, and subconscious
      process that individuals need no awareness. This ability means that this
      process is fundamentally the same for everyone;<br />hence, natural and
      acquired pieces of language utilizes intuitively, where the individual, in
      opposition to learning, does not need time to think and form sentences
      using learned grammar and<br />vocabulary. And finally, subconscious means
      that the individual is unaware that the process is happening; the
      acquisition process may not feel like "language learning." When new
      knowledge<br />is acquired, the acquirer does not feel like they have
      learned anything. The acquisition requires meaningful interaction with the
      target language, during which the acquirer focuses on meaning<br />
      rather than form. This method means, one is not concerned with the
      structure of the language they hear and(or) their utterances. They are
      with the messages they are conveying and understanding.<br /><b
        >"Learning Japanese" may improperly refer to both acquiring and
        learning. So please keep that in mind.</b
