    <h3>
      新日本語ガイ <b><u>New Japanese Guide</u></b>
    </h3>

    <p>
      I know that the following guide is long. But language learning is
      something you do in the long term, so please take the time to read this
      guide in its entirety. I apologize if this guide may get a little
      scientific, and I will not write a simplified version of this guide.
      Everything stated below is what you need to know. Sorry about that.
    </p>

    <h4>Why many people "fail" to learn Japanese</h4>

    <p>
      Before I talk about this, I would like to clarify what I mean by "fail."
      What I mean is, not being able to achieve their goals. Many people love
      the idea of being fluent, and being able to watch Japanese media without
      subtitles, in their raw form. However, many people also don't ever reach
      this goal or even get close. I believe it mostly isn't their fault, but
      rather, the method's fault. Whether you're a "visual learner" or an
      "auditory learner" does not mean anything when it comes to learning a
      language, you have a big problem if you acquired your first language
      auditorily, but apparently, you're more of a "visual learner." It mostly
      comes down to the method used to study Japanese. There are other factors,
      too, such as motivation, or hours spent each day/consistency. But I
      believe the process in the first place is critical. For example, if
      someone told you that you could lose weight by pedaling on an exercise
      bike while watching TV, and you did this for two hours every day, would
      you lose weight? No. That is because this is a fundamentally flawed method
      - it does not work.
    </p>
    <p>
      This guide aims to educate you on effective methods to study Japanese so
      that you don't end up like the others that failed and instead succeed, all
      while having fun in your target language. In this case, your target
      language is most likely Japanese Back to the "visual learner" and
      "auditory learner" thing, while it may be right for other fields of study,
      it is not valid for acquiring a language. We all receive communication in
      the same way, and that is through comprehensible input. I often come
      across people saying, "everyone learns differently" This may be true for
      other fields of study but not for language acquisition. Keyword:
      Acquisition.
    </p>

    <h4>Learning vs. Acquisition</h4>

    <p>
      Learning a language properly refers to a conscious process, similar to
      what one experiences in school. The individual receives "grammar rules"
      and(or) a "vocabulary list" to remember. When it comes to communicating in
      the language, they recall these rules and vocab they have learned and try
      to speak the language. According to Krashen, this is less effective than
      Acquisition.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Acquisition of language is a natural, intuitive, and subconscious
      process that individuals need no awareness. This ability means that this
      process is fundamentally the same for everyone; hence, natural and
      acquired pieces of language utilizes intuitively, where the individual, in
      opposition to learning, does not need time to think and form sentences
      using learned grammar and vocabulary. And finally, subconscious means that
      the individual is unaware that the process is happening; the acquisition
      process may not feel like "language learning." When new knowledge is
      acquired, the acquirer does not feel like they have learned anything. The
      acquisition requires meaningful interaction with the target language,
      during which the acquirer focuses on meaning rather than form. This method
      means, one is not concerned with the structure of the language they hear
      and(or) their utterances. They are with the messages they are conveying
      and understanding.<b
        >"Learning Japanese" may improperly refer to both acquiring and
        learning. So please keep that in mind.</b

    <h4>i + 1</h4>

    <p>
      If i represents previously acquired linguistic competence and
      extra-linguistic knowledge, the hypothesis claims that we move from i to
      i+1 by understanding input that contains i+1. Extra-linguistic instruction
      includes our understanding of the world and the situation, that is, the
      context. The +1 represents 'the next increment' of new knowledge or
      language structure within the learner's capacity to acquire. In simpler
      terms, i+1 means "one [and no more than one] thing [piece of language] you
      do not yet know in the sentence."
    </p>

    <h4>Comprehensible Input</h4>
    <p>
      The input itself refers to listening and reading to native content in the
      target language. Mass data accumulation refers to as immersion. Native
      content means content made by natives, for natives. (raw) Natives make
      anime for natives; therefore, it is native content. Comprehensible input
      refers to input where messages are conveyed and understood. It is the most
      crucial ingredient in the Acquisition of language. Any data is not
      sufficient for Acquisition, the data must be understandable. However, as a
      beginner, it may seem challenging to find comprehensible input, and that
      is true. I will touch later on how you can benefit from incomprehensible
      information, too, but not in the same way. You do not acquire language
      from incomprehensible input but comprehensible input. So please keep that
      in mind. It is also essential to keep in mind that talking (output) is not
      practicing a language. When people give anecdotes of how they got better
      at a speech by speaking a lot, they do not realize that it was the input
      (from the partner), which improved their language skills. Speaking
      (output) is just the icing on the cake, and data(input) is where you
      acquire language.
    </p>

    <h4>Knowing who's advice to trust</h4>

    <p>
      It may seem natural to take as many people's opinions as possible; after
      all, they have the experience, right? Maybe you can learn something
      valuable? Well, not quite. If the person you are taking advice from has
      not achieved similar goals you're aiming for; you cannot trust their
      information. If you do, you will get no better than the low level they are
      now. As a beginner, you have no way to accurately judge someone's language
      ability, as your linguistic competence is very low or virtually
      nonexistent. Therefore you are no one to decide if your friend is good at
      Japanese or not. Why is this important? Because I often come across people
      who say things like, "But my friend who learns Japanese told me that…" The
      thought that the friend told the other friend is usually pretty misguided
      and blatantly false. Has your friend achieved something close to what you
      want to make? If not, you do not have much luck getting past the low level
      they are at if you follow their advice. It would be like taking dieting
      advice from someone fat. " Learning" Japanese Effectively Now that you
      know the basics of language acquisition, let's dive into how to learn
      Japanese.
    </p>

    <h4>Kana</h4>

    <p>
      Kana refers to Hiragana and Katakana, and they are the two scripts of the
      Japanese language. Hiragana and Katakana are two versions of the same
      sounds in the literature. Hiragana is used for words and names not written
      in kanji and for analytical purposes. The writer can choose whether or not
      to use the kanji form. We use Katakana for words borrowed from other
      languages and foreign names. We also use it for emphasis; however, the
      usages of hiragana and Katakana are not always consistent, so note that.
      The kana is not hard to master, and therefore I'd say, learn it however
      you want. It's better if you have audio with it, too. Mnemonics may seem
      like a good idea, but I've seen people complain that it makes recalling
      the kana slower, so I'd say just brute force it.
      <b>You need to learn this first.</b>I recommend you read Tae Kim (linked
      in #resources) and pause after The Writing System. After that, copy out
      the kana chart below and then test yourself.
    </p>

    <h5>The Chart:</h5>

    <h5>Steps if you got confused:</h5>

    <p>
      <ol>
          <li>Read Tae Kim (linked in #resources) until you complete The Writing System </li>
          <li>Copy out the chart above into a notebook or something similar. </li>
          <li>Test yourself.</li>
      </ol>
      After a week or so, you should have all the kana nailed down.
