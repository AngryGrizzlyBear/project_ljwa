                <p>
                    When approaching grammar, it is essential to know that the purpose of a
                    grammar guide is not to make you a master at the language. It is to give
                    you only a basic understanding of how things work in the language, and
                    then a real knowledge of grammar can only be achieved through immersion.
                    Therefore, I recommend you choose a grammar guide, read/watch it,
                    <b>and</b> do immersion.
                </p>

                <h4 class="center">Choosing A Grammar Guide</h4>

                <p>
                    There are many grammar guides out there, some are good, but some are bad.
                    To prevent confusion amongst learners, I will only mention two grammar
                    guides. Tae Kim and Cure Dolly. No grammar guide is perfect; they each
                    have their ups and downs. Tae Kim's guide reads pretty well and very
                    beginner-friendly; however, some of his explanations may be a little off,
                    which can get annoying to read. Cure Dolly takes an unorthodox approach to
                    Japanese grammar, trying to teach Japanese grammar in a more Japanese
                    "organic" way. However, Cure Dolly is not an absolute beginner-friendly
                    way to start, and you need at least some background knowledge before using
                    it. Also, the audio is poor.
                </p>

                <p>You can find the two grammar guides below:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <a href=" http://www.guidetojapanese.org/grammar_guide.pdf/">Tae Kim:</a>
                        <i>There is also an Android and iOS app for offline viewing! Note that
                            everything in this guide is basic Japanese, even the "advanced"
                            section.</i>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <a href=" https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLg9uYxuZf8x_A-vcqqyOFZu06WlhnypWj">Cure
                            Dolly</a>
                        <i>I recommend turning on subtitles and setting the speed to 1.25x!</i>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    With that said, I suggest doing grammar study in conjunction with your
                    immersion and vocabulary study.
                </p>

                <h4 class="center">How to Immerse</h4>

                <p>
                    What you need to do when immersing is different depending on what stage
                    you are on. This reason is why making a one size fits all Japanese guide
                    is tricky. I will only go through what you need to do as a beginner.
