                <p>
                    I know that the following guide is long. But language learning is
                    something you do in the long term, so please take the time to read
                    this guide in its entirety. I apologize if this guide may get a
                    little scientific, and I will not write a simplified version of this
                    guide. Everything stated below is what you need to know. Sorry about
                    that.

                <h4 class="center">Why many people "fail" to learn Japanese</h4>

                <p>
                    Before I talk about this, I would like to clarify what I mean by
                    "fail." What I mean is, not being able to achieve their goals. Many
                    people love the idea of being fluent, and being able to watch
                    Japanese media without subtitles, in their raw form. However, many
                    people also don't ever reach this goal or even get close. I believe
                    it mostly isn't their fault, but rather, the method's fault. Whether
                    you're a "visual learner" or an "auditory learner" does not mean
                    anything when it comes to learning a language, you have a big
                    problem if you acquired your first language auditorily, but
                    apparently, you're more of a "visual learner." It mostly comes down
                    to the method used to study Japanese. There are other factors, too,
                    such as motivation, or hours spent each day/consistency. But I
                    believe the process in the first place is critical. For example, if
                    someone told you that you could lose weight by pedaling on an
                    exercise bike while watching TV, and you did this for two hours
                    every day, would you lose weight? No. That is because this is a
                    fundamentally flawed method - it does not work.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This guide aims to educate you on effective methods to study
                    Japanese so that you don't end up like the others that failed and
                    instead succeed, all while having fun in your target language. In
                    this case, your target language is most likely Japanese Back to the
                    "visual learner" and "auditory learner" thing, while it may be right
                    for other fields of study, it is not valid for acquiring a language.
                    We all receive communication in the same way, and that is through
                    comprehensible input. I often come across people saying, "everyone
                    learns differently" This may be true for other fields of study but
                    not for language acquisition. Keyword: Acquisition.

                <h4 class="center">Learning vs. Acquisition</h4>

                <p>
                    Learning a language properly refers to a conscious process, similar
                    to what one experiences in school. The individual receives "grammar
                    rules" and(or) a "vocabulary list" to remember. When it comes to
                    communicating in the language, they recall these rules and vocab
                    they have learned and try to speak the language. According to
                    Krashen, this is less effective than Acquisition.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Acquisition of language is a natural, intuitive, and
                    subconscious process that individuals need no awareness. This
                    ability means that this process is fundamentally the same for
                    everyone; hence, natural and acquired pieces of language utilizes
                    intuitively, where the individual, in opposition to learning, does
                    not need time to think and form sentences using learned grammar and
                    vocabulary. And finally, subconscious means that the individual is
                    unaware that the process is happening; the acquisition process may
                    not feel like "language learning." When new knowledge is acquired,
                    the acquirer does not feel like they have learned anything. The
                    acquisition requires meaningful interaction with the target
                    language, during which the acquirer focuses on meaning rather than
                    form. This method means, one is not concerned with the structure of
                    the language they hear and(or) their utterances. They are with the
                    messages they are conveying and understanding.<b>"Learning Japanese" may improperly refer to both
                        acquiring and
                        learning. So please keep that in mind.</b>
                </p>

                <h4 class="center">i + 1</h4>

                <p>
                    If i represents previously acquired linguistic competence and
                    extra-linguistic knowledge, the hypothesis claims that we move from
                    i to i+1 by understanding input that contains i+1. Extra-linguistic
                    instruction includes our understanding of the world and the
                    situation, that is, the context. The +1 represents 'the next
                    increment' of new knowledge or language structure within the
                    learner's capacity to acquire. In simpler terms, i+1 means "one [and
                    no more than one] thing [piece of language] you do not yet know in
                    the sentence."
                </p>

                <h4 class="center">Comprehensible Input</h4>
                <p>
                    The input itself refers to listening and reading to native content
                    in the target language. Mass data accumulation refers to as
                    immersion. Native content means content made by natives, for
                    natives. (raw) Natives make anime for natives; therefore, it is
                    native content. Comprehensible input refers to input where messages
                    are conveyed and understood. It is the most crucial ingredient in
                    the Acquisition of language. Any data is not sufficient for
                    Acquisition, the data must be understandable. However, as a
                    beginner, it may seem challenging to find comprehensible input, and
                    that is true. I will touch later on how you can benefit from
                    incomprehensible information, too, but not in the same way. You do
                    not acquire language from incomprehensible input but comprehensible
                    input. So please keep that in mind. It is also essential to keep in
                    mind that talking (output) is not practicing a language. When people
                    give anecdotes of how they got better at a speech by speaking a lot,
                    they do not realize that it was the input (from the partner), which
                    improved their language skills. Speaking (output) is just the icing
                    on the cake, and data(input) is where you acquire language.
                </p>

                <h4 class="center">Knowing who's advice to trust</h4>

                <p>
                    It may seem natural to take as many people's opinions as possible;
                    after all, they have the experience, right? Maybe you can learn
                    something valuable? Well, not quite. If the person you are taking
                    advice from has not achieved similar goals you're aiming for; you
                    cannot trust their information. If you do, you will get no better
                    than the low level they are now. As a beginner, you have no way to
                    accurately judge someone's language ability, as your linguistic
                    competence is very low or virtually nonexistent. Therefore you are
                    no one to decide if your friend is good at Japanese or not. Why is
                    this important? Because I often come across people who say things
                    like, "But my friend who learns Japanese told me that…" The thought
                    that the friend told the other friend is usually pretty misguided
                    and blatantly false. Has your friend achieved something close to
                    what you want to make? If not, you do not have much luck getting
                    past the low level they are at if you follow their advice. It would
                    be like taking dieting advice from someone fat. " Learning" Japanese
                    Effectively Now that you know the basics of language acquisition,
                    let's dive into how to learn Japanese.
