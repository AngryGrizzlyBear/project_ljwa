                <p>
                    Kana refers to Hiragana and Katakana, and they are the two scripts of
                    the Japanese language. Hiragana and Katakana are two versions of the
                    same sounds in the literature. Hiragana is used for words and names not
                    written in kanji and for analytical purposes. The writer can choose
                    whether or not to use the kanji form. We use Katakana for words borrowed
                    from other languages and foreign names. We also use it for emphasis;
                    however, the usages of hiragana and Katakana are not always consistent,
                    so note that. The kana is not hard to master, and therefore I'd say,
                    learn it however you want. It's better if you have audio with it, too.
                    Mnemonics may seem like a good idea, but I've seen people complain that
                    it makes recalling the kana slower, so I'd say just brute force it.
                    <b>You need to learn this first.</b>I recommend you read Tae Kim (linked
                    in #resources) and pause after The Writing System. After that, copy out
                    the kana chart below and then test yourself.

                        Read Tae Kim (linked in #resources) until you complete The Writing

                    <li>Copy out the chart above into a notebook or something similar.</li>

                </ul>
                <p class="center">
                    After a week or so, you should have all the kana nailed down.
