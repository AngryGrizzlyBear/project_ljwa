          <p>
            Kanji, literally meaning "Chinese Characters" is the third part of
            the Japanese writing system. They are logographic and, therefore,
            much more complicated than kana. There are 2136 kanji taught in the
            Japanese school system; however, don't let this fool you. People use
            three thousand or more Kanji in daily life. People use Kanji all the
            time. You will eventually understand what this means when you get a
            little more advanced in Japanese.

          <h4 class="center">Approaching Kanji - Kanji With Vocab vs. Isolated Kanji Study</h4>

          <p>
            There are two ways to approach Kanji. One is
            <b>Kanji with vocab</b>, which is to learn words from reading
            without studying the individual Kanji. You can fully comprehend
            "守銭奴" without knowing what the individual Kanji means by looking
            it up in a dictionary. The other is <b>an isolated kanji study</b>,
            studying the meaning and composition of the individual Kanji.
            Example: "守" "guard" "銭" "coin" "奴" "guy" = cheapskate. Huh? It's
            pretty smart. Isolated kanji study can make remembering vocab
            easier, but it can put you behind due to the amount of time it
            takes, so it is up to you to decide whether it is worth it. If you
            struggle with reading words, then you should do an isolated kanji
            study. ※ Another interesting thing about Kanji with vocab is that if
            you know other words that also use the Kanji of said word, it can
            become easier to remember. (Example: If you can comprehend "守護,"
            "銭湯," and "売国奴," then "守銭奴" becomes easier.)

          <h4 class="center">How to: Kanji with Vocab</h4>

          <p>
            This method is the most straightforward approach to Kanji, and it is
            the approach I took personally. Look at the image above. Most people
            will read the kana just by referring to the kana chart, but you
            can't do the same for Kanji. So how do you learn to read Kanji? Look
            at the first panel. You see "人数"? That's a word. Look it up in a
            dictionary such as
            <a href="https://jisho.org/.">jisho</a> You get the reading:
            "にんずう" and the meaning: "number of people." Cool, move on.
            That's it. But don't expect to remember words just by looking it up
            once. That is why you should read a lot to build up and retain kanji
            skills. At the end of the guide, I will go through how to make
            looking up words smoother.

          <p>
            When approaching Kanji as a beginner, they can look like scribbles
            rather than familiar shapes, like how a native sees Kanji. Kanji
            have common shapes and patterns, and Isolated Kanji Study helps you
            see those common shapes and designs. Instead of "草," looking like a
            random drawing, you can see that it's composed of "艹," "日," and
            "十." You can use RRTK (Recognition Remembering the Kanji), a
            shortened version of the original RTK (Remembering the Kanji). You
            can find more details about this over at
            <a
              href="https://massimmersionapproach.com/table-of-contents/stage-1/practice/recognition-rtk"
            >
              Mass Immersion Approach</a
            >.
          </p>
          <p>
            RRTK breaks up the Kanji into "elements," as demonstrated with the
            kanji "草" earlier. Seeing Kanji as familiar shapes is a primary
            benefit of RRTK, and memorizing the meanings is a secondary benefit.
            Knowing the purposes can be pretty handy; however, over time, these
            meanings fade away and only act as a crutch. To truly "learn" Kanji,
            you still need to read Japanese for thousands of hours, so in the
            end, you're going to be doing Kanji with vocab anyway. Think of
            isolated kanji study as your training wheels for Kanji with vocab.
