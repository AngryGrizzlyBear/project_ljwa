                <p>
                    Mining means when you add vocabulary (often along with the sentence
                    they're discovered in) into your Anki deck. You can then review these
                    flashcards overtime to make sure you don't forget them. Mining is
                    something you will be doing for a long time, so this is pretty darn
                    important. There's a lot of disagreement when it comes to "formats" of
                    mining. I think you should just experiment and see what works best for
                    you.
                </p>

                <p>There are two main formats of mining:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>i+1 Sentence Cards</li>
                    <li>High-Quality Vocab Cards (known as Anime Cards)</li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    There has been no settlement to which one is the "best"; they each have
                    their benefits and drawbacks.
                </p>

                <h4 class="center">
                    i+1 Sentence Cards
                </h4>

                <p>
                    I+1 Sentence Cards are cards with an i+1 sentence with all its Kanji on
                    the front and the piece of information needed to understand what it means
                    on the back. Let's go through the benefits and drawbacks.
                </p>
                <p><u>Benefits:</u></p>

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Easier to judge whether you should pass (as opposed to failing) the
                        card, as the task is simple: understand the sentence without revealing
                        the back
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Less likely to mix up similar words, as their sentences are different.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Easier overall, as sentences are closer to how we use language in real
                        life.
                    </li>
                    <li>I+1 format is so inherently more accessible than the alternative.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><u>Drawbacks:</u></p>

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Long to review as you need to read the full sentence every time. - As it
                        is i+1, this may restrict what words you can put in your Anki deck. As
                        you can only add sentences where there is one piece of language you do
                        not yet know.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h4 class="center">High Quality Vocab Cards</h4>

                <p>
                    Vocab cards are different from standard vocab cards. Standard vocab cards
                    simply have the word in kanji form on the front and the reading and
                    meaning of that word at the back. High-quality vocab cards, as opposed to
                    standard vocab cards, have the audio of the sentence (from an anime or
                    voiced VN), also a picture (from an anime or VN), and the sentence it came
                    from at the back. Making them much more superior to standard vocab cards.
                    â€» They are known as "Anime Cards" because of the
                    <a href=" https://www.animecards.site/home">tutorial/site</a>
                </p>

                <p><u>Benefits:</u></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Quick to review. I average 500 cards in 30 minutes with these.</li>
                    <li>Able to mine everything and anything (does not follow i+1)</li>
                    <li>
                        Animecards.site: "has the same benefits as sentence cards" this can be
                        disputed, though.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p><u>Drawbacks:</u></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Significantly harder than i+1 sentence cards. For the same reason, Core
                        2K is harder than Tango N5+N4.
                    </li>
                    <li>Much more likely to mix up similar words.</li>
                    <li>
                        Not beginner-friendly. I do not recommend a beginner do this until they
                        have at least 1000 i+1 sentence cards. We may not learn concepts as well
                        as with i+1 sentence cards.
