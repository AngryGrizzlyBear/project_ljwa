                <p>
                    Reading, no matter what stage you are at, can benefit you greatly.
                    However, as a beginner to the language, there are a few problems. You're
                    still learning in the earlier stages of the learning process. Reading as
                    soon as possible can harm your accent. And your reading ability may not
                    always transfer (being able to hear the new words you learned) to your
                    listening ability, especially if your listening ability is considerably
                    low. When you're a beginner, I recommend watching Japanese subtitled anime
                    for reading practice. Japanese subtitles are reading immersion at best,
                    similar to a voiced visual novel. Having the voices in the background
                    isn't going to save your accent nor improve your listening skill, you need
                    to do raw listening. Sorry DJT. Anyway, I think it is good to start with
                    Japanese subtitles for reading. And the transition to manga, and then
                    light novels and so on. I believe it is essential you pace yourself when
                    reading and don't burn out trying to read hard stories as a beginner; it
                    is usually better reading books that are not too far off from your level.
                    In our resources channel, you can find links to sites that let you read a
                    lot of Japanese manga and novels (for free!) There are Japanese subtitles
                    too, so make sure you check that out!
                </p>

                <h4 class="center">Finding the balance between listening and reading</h4>
                <p>
                    Balance is important. It may be obvious just to split your time up in
                    half, and if you can do that, then that is great. However, not everyone
                    has the time, and when it comes to reading, depending on your current
                    level, it's difficult to read for extended hours. For example, people that
                    have gotten further in the Tango Anki deck may be able to read longer than
                    those who are a little behind. So what is the perfect balance? I cannot
                    answer that, that is up to you to experiment and decide. It all depends on
                    your schedule and current level. You don't need to do reading from day 1,
                    give it a few weeks until you can learn essential words from the Tango N5
                    Anki deck.
