        <p>
          The bulk of your language learning journey is learning vocabulary to
          be doing a lot of it. I recommend you start learning vocabulary
          using Anki after learning the kana and knowing fundamental grammar.
          How basic it is, it is up to you to decide.
        </p>
        <p>
          <a href="https://apps.ankiweb.net/">Anki</a> is a spaced repetition
          (SRS) flashcard program.I recommend you use Anki to build up a
          vocabulary of essential words to assist your immersion. After that,
          learning vocabulary from immersion becomes easier. Usually, people
          use the Core 2K deck to build up a dictionary of two thousand words;
          however, I advise against using Core 2K and suggest you do Tango
          N5+N4 instead. Here's why:
        </p>
        <p>
          Core 2K is significantly harder than Tango N5+N4 because Tango has
          the sentence on the front, Core 2K has only the word on the front.
          Sentences make recalling vocabulary easier; after all, it is much
          more close to how we use language in real life than isolated words.
          <b>However, it is essential to note that Tango's translations are
            not literal and do not represent Japanese structure well, so I
            guess that's Tango's flaw. In other cases, it might be utterly
            wrong.</b>
          People have always struggled with Core 2K, and to make the process
          smoother, I recommend Tango N5+N4 over Core 2K. Especially if you
          don't want to do isolated kanji study!
