                    When you are a beginner, I recommend doing listening immersion over
                    reading immersion. When you first approach a foreign language, you are not
                    yet used to the phonemes (sounds) of the language. Reading may give you a
                    poor accent, this is when you associate similar, yet wrong phonemes from
                    your native language to Japanese. It is impossible to read without mapping
                    some phonetic components, so you can only avoid this by first getting used
                    to the phonemes. You can do this by doing raw listening. Secondly,
                    listening just flows without stopping, so you feel more comfortable when
                    immersing. On the other hand, reading as a beginner is very frustrating as
                    you need to look up words probably every second continually. Surprisingly,
                    there are many i+1 opportunities in listening immersion as a beginner, so
                    it still passes as comprehensible input, even if you don't understand
                    other parts. But language is not acquired through incomprehensible input,
                    remember? That is true; however, you are still benefiting from
                    incomprehensible information but in a different way; it improves your
                    ability to distinguish phonemes; in other words, giving you a better
                    accent. Immersing even if you don't understand much is also a great way to
                    build up a habit of interacting with your target language. With that said,
                    immersion (input) at this stage will still be mostly incomprehensible;
                    however, you can change that by working through the Tango Anki decks.
                    Please note that you need to pay attention to your immersion. (Active
                    Immersion). Just putting it on in the background (Passive Immersion) is
                    not going to help you.

                <h4 class="center">Choosing what to immerse with</h4>
                <p>
                    It's usually best to engage with a visual and audio component, such as
                    anime and j-drama (TV Show). TV shows have a visual element, and also a
                    plot, so this brings more i+1 opportunities. I do not recommend to immerse
                    with say, a podcast or an audiobook as a beginner, as you will have no
                    idea what's going on (incomprehensible input). If you're in this server
                    (Learn Japanese with Anime), then chances are you are a fan of anime,
                    cool. You can use that to immerse, and even anime you have seen in the
                    past. What is also pretty helpful is reading an episode summary of the
                    episode on Wikipedia before watching it, this can help you understand the
                    plot more, so you can make more acquisition gains.

                    Try to understand the messages. There is a lot you can infer from a TV
                    show. Like Krashen says, you need to have "meaningful" (meaning-focused)
                    interaction with the language, rather than focusing on form (such as
                    grammar). I suggest trying to hear the sounds more clearly, too?
