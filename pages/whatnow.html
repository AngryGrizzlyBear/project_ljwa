                <i>(Some of the following information requires you to be in the discord for
                    maximum effectiveness.)</i>
                <p>
                    Learn the kana by copying out the entire chart posted in the Kana section
                    into a notebook, or something similar. Use the @Kotoba bot in the #quiz
                    channel to test your knowledge, there is a specific command you need to
                    use, so it doesn't stop until you get them all right (brute-forcing)
                </p>
                <p>The command is as below:</p>
                <p>
                    (if you're in the discord) k!quiz-conquest hiragana+katakana no delay
                    After you have passed the @Kotoba quiz, then you should move on to
                    learning vocabulary alongside grammar. It is vital that you pace yourself
                    and don't try to punch above your weight; this is not a race.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Download and set up Anki, you can find the link above or in #resources,
                    then download the Tango N5 deck. You can find the download links for this
                    in #resources in the Anki section. I've updated the link to use a safer
                    file host. (Mediafire â†’ Google Drive) You can import the Tango N5 deck by
                    clicking on it. It should open in Anki, wait a while for it to import.
                    Click the cog icon next to the deck Options. The default limit of new
                    cards per day set at 20. Try to stick with this number for a few days and
                    see how it goes for you, if you feel like it is too much, you can lower
                    the limit to 15 or even 10. Check in the "Reviews" tab, set the Maximum
                    reviews/day to 9999. Don't be startled by this number. It will likely not
                    go over 150 with an okay retention rate. If you fail to keep up with the
                    reviews, you are getting, lower your new cards/day instead of reducing the
                    maximum reviews. This method is because not doing your due reviews
                    interferes with Anki's spaced repetition system. Anki requires consistency
                    in the long term for it to be effective, try creating a schedule for it. I
                    do my Anki when I wake up in the morning. Work on the Tango N5 Anki deck
                    while reading/watching your chosen grammar guide. After you have finished
                    Tango N5, do Tango N4, too. The download link for it is also in the
                    #resources channel. You should also be nearing the end of your grammar
                    guide at this point. I also suggest starting to read manga at this point.
                    After you finished Tango N4, you should set up a mining deck. It doesn't
                    matter that much which one you pick.

                <p>
                    That's it. You can get fluent in Japanese just like that. But don't forget
                    that the most crucial part is immersion, Anki and grammar only assist your
                    immersion. <b>Music is not immersion.</b> However, you can use the lyric
                    sheet as reading practice. This guide would not have been possible if it
                    was not for Stephen Krashen, Mass Immersion Approach, All Japanese All The
                    Time, AntiMoon, Daily Japanese Thread/Itazuraneko, and my brothers and
                    sisters here in Learn Japanese with Anime Discord. Thank you all!

                    Get Yomichan. It is a browser extension. You can find it in #resources,
                    and the dictionaries you need to load into it too. Download my dictionary
                    pack (#resources), extract it (you can use 7zip). Do not touch the .zip
                    files inside. These need to be kept intact. Click the icon, then click the
                    monkey wrench icon scroll down until you see "Import Dictionary," over
                    here, you need to import the ones with the [Bilingual] tag and
                    (optionally) the [Kanji] tag at the stage you are in your studies. You can
                    only import one dictionary at a time, so wait until one dictionary imports
                    before downloading the next. Now you can look up words on a webpage by
                    just holding Shift and hovering over it. Try it! For manga, I recommend
                    KanjiTomo; it's like Yomichan, but for situations where you can't select
                    the text, e.g., manga. It uses an OCR, so a little less reliable than
                    Yomichan. To apply, hover your mouse over whatever you want to look up. If
                    you have an Android device, you can use Yomichan on Firefox. Or
                    JP-Dictionary (by @Kamui), which adds the iOS "Look Up" feature to your
                    select menu, you can find this in #resources. There is also OCR Manga
                    Reader (get it in #resources), which works like KanjiTomo. Typhon Reader,
                    which operates more like Yomichan. You can load .epub files into it, so it
                    is the best way to read Japanese novels on your phone. Individual EPWING
                    dictionaries can load into Typhon Reader. I find this very useful. You can
                    find EPWING dictionaries in #resources. There's also Kaku; it's a
                    system-wide OCR. Pretty useful too. If you use an iOS device, you can use
                    iBooks, or "Books" as it is in newer versions of iOS. You can use the
                    "Look Up" feature. Make sure you have Japanese dictionaries enabled in
                    Settings - General - Dictionary. If you intend on playing Visual Novels,
                    then make sure you set up text hooking, you can find out how to do that
